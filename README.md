# AppAutomationTestingChallenge

## Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio Community Edition
  - Specflow
  - Appium
  - NUnit
- Appium Server
- ADB - Android Debug Bridge

## Framework
I used specflow to connect the BDDs(cucumber test cases) with the code.

## Challenge Question No. 2 - Write automation based on the sample projec6t you chose.
I have written the challenge question feature files for automation as below:
- Challenge1-MovieViewDetails.feature
- Challenge2-MovieFavoritesScreen.feature (As the filtering movies feature based on popular or year is not available with any android application, so I have written a different test case which seems more copmlex than the one given in challenge) 

## Challenge Question No. 3 Cucumber UI Features:
Below are the UI feature files (not automated):
- Movie Screen.feature
- TV Shows screen.feature

## Challenge Question No. 4 - Network tests
- Network Task.zip (The network traffic is captured through Fiddler)
